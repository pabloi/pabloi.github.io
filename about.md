I was born in Montevideo, Uruguay. I hold a professional degree in Electrical Engineering and a Master's in Electrical Engineering from the Universidad de la República in Montevideo, Uruguay (2009 and 2012), and a PhD in Bioengineering from the University of Pittsburgh (2019). I also completed the graduate training program from the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, a joint center from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.

I did my PhD work at Pitt's [Sensorimotor Learning Lab](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/subsites/Labs/sml/) on the mathematical characterization of the dynamics of muscle activity and perception of belt-speed symmetry during split-belt treadmill walking adaptation.

I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Engineering of the Universidad Católica del Uruguay, where I co-lead the [Movement Engineering Lab](https://ucumovinglab.github.io).

My research focuses on motor control, biomechanics, and technologies for movement rehabilitation. This interdisciplinary work draws from neuroscience, engineering, and movement science. Current research directions include:

- **Human movement and motor control**: Using electromyography (EMG), inertial measurement units (IMUs), and motion capture to study locomotion and understand how the nervous system controls movement
- **Movement rehabilitation tools**: Developing interactive feedback systems and advanced orthotic devices to help recover movement after neurological injuries
- **Movement digitalization**: Applying computer vision, signal processing, and AI methods for motion analysis

I am also interested in machine learning for dimensionality reduction of electromyographic signals and Bayesian models for understanding perceptual recalibration during motor adaptation.
