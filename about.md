I was born in Montevideo, Uruguay. I hold a degree in Electrical Engineering (professional, 2009) and a a Master's in Electrical Engineering (2012) from the Universidad de la Rep\'ublica in Montevideo, Uruguay, and a PhD in Bioengineering from the University of Pittsburgh (2019). 
I did my PhD work at Pitt's [Sensorimotor Learning Lab](http://www.engineering.pitt.edu/Sub-Sites/Labs/SML_Lab/_Content/Home/Homepage/) on the mathematical characterization of the dynamics of muscle activity and perception of belt-speed symmetry during split-belt treadmill walking adaptation.

I am interested in signal processing, machine learning, computational motor control and sensory characterization.

You can find my [CV here](to be added)
