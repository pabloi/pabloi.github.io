Hello, and welcome to my personal page! I am a researcher in motor control, with an interest in data science and machine learning. In this page you can find some information [about me](/about/), including a list of my [publications](/pubs/) and some of my [coding projects](/code/).

## Research Labs

I am the Principal Investigator at the [Movement Engineering Lab](https://ucumovinglab.github.io) at Universidad Católica del Uruguay. Our lab focuses on understanding human movement through a combination of motor control theory, biomechanics, and engineering.

I completed my PhD at the [Sensorimotor Learning Lab](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/subsites/Labs/sml/) at the University of Pittsburgh under the supervision of [Dr. Gelsy Torres-Oviedo](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/people/faculty/gelsy-torres-oviedo/).
